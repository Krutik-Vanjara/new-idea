## ** System Architecture for AI-Powered Task Manager with Microservices**

### **Project Overview**
The task manager application is designed to be lightweight, intuitive, and capable of integrating machine learning models to enhance task management functionality. The application will be developed using a **microservice architecture**, where each service is isolated, and the backend is built using **Docker** containers. The task manager will also integrate AI agents to handle specific tasks like task categorization, reminders, or intelligent suggestions.

### **Technologies Stack**
1. **Frontend**:
   - **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React will be used for the frontend due to its component-based architecture and fast rendering, allowing easy development of an intuitive and lightweight task manager interface.
   - **Webpack**: For bundling JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files, ensuring an optimized build process and enabling hot reloading for frontend development.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Node.js** with **Express.js**: This will serve as the backend for the task manager, providing an API for communication between the frontend and backend. Express is lightweight, fast, and works seamlessly with Node.js.
   - **Machine Learning Integration**: 
     - For AI capabilities, pre-built open-source models will be used, such as **HuggingFace** transformers or **TensorFlow.js** for integrating machine learning directly into the application.
     - Python-based models can be exposed via API endpoints using **Flask** or **FastAPI** to allow interaction with Node.js via HTTP.

3. **Database**:
   - **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database will store user tasks, their statuses, and other relevant data. MongoDB works well with microservices and can scale horizontally as needed.

4. **CI/CD and Docker**:
   - **Docker**: Docker containers will be used to isolate each microservice, ensuring that the application is scalable and easily deployable.
   - **GitLab CI/CD**: This will enable continuous integration, ensuring automated testing, code quality checks (SAST), and deployment pipelines.
   - **Docker Compose**: For defining and managing multi-container Docker applications, ensuring all microservices and databases are isolated yet work seamlessly together.

5. **Containerization & Hot Reload**:
   - **Docker Volumes**: Ensure data persistence for MongoDB and other services.
   - **Frontend Hot Reloading**: Set up Webpack’s hot module replacement (HMR) for real-time updates during development without needing to restart the application.

### **System Architecture**

#### **1. High-Level Architecture**

The architecture consists of three main layers:

- **Frontend Layer** (Client Side)
- **Backend Layer** (Microservices)
- **Database Layer** (MongoDB)

These layers communicate over REST APIs and WebSocket connections.

##### **Frontend Layer**:
- **React** serves as the frontend user interface.
- The frontend interacts with the backend via HTTP (REST) API and WebSocket for real-time updates.

##### **Backend Layer**:
- The backend will consist of **two microservices**:
  1. **Task Management Service (TMS)**:
     - Handles CRUD operations for tasks (creating, updating, deleting tasks, etc.).
     - Stores and retrieves tasks in MongoDB.
  2. **AI Service**:
     - Integrates with pre-trained machine learning models for AI-powered task suggestions, task categorization, and intelligent reminders.
     - Provides a REST API that the frontend can query to make use of the machine learning models.

Both microservices will run in **isolated containers**. The services will only communicate via HTTP APIs, ensuring proper isolation.

##### **Database Layer**:
- **MongoDB** will be used for both task storage and for any user-related data (e.g., preferences).
- The MongoDB container will be separate, with its own volume for data persistence.

#### **2. Detailed Architecture and Containers**

The following diagram represents the architecture of the application with the corresponding containers:

```plaintext
Frontend (React) <-> Backend (Node.js) <-> AI Service (Python-based ML API)
                                   |
                             MongoDB (Container)
```

##### **Containers Breakdown**:
1. **Frontend Container** (1):
   - React app hosted in a container with Webpack for hot reloading.
   - Runs on `localhost:3000` during development.

2. **Backend Containers** (2):
   - **Task Management Service (TMS)** container (Node.js + Express).
   - **AI Service** container (Python, Flask/FastAPI) for integrating pre-trained ML models.
   
3. **Database Container** (1):
   - **MongoDB** container to persist task data.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated deployment via **GitLab CI/CD**, with security checks, SAST for Dockerfiles, and Docker Hub deployment.

### **Container Communication**:
- Containers communicate over an isolated **Docker network** created by Docker Compose.
- Each backend container (TMS and AI Service) communicates with MongoDB via MongoDB URI, ensuring no other service has access to the database container directly.

### **Persistence & Volumes**:
- **MongoDB Volume**: A Docker volume is used for MongoDB data persistence.
- Each microservice will have its own volume for data persistence.

---

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

The CI/CD pipeline will be hosted on **GitLab**, and it will handle:
1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** for Dockerfiles.
2. **Automated Testing** to ensure that every commit doesn’t break functionality.
3. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - Once the code passes the tests, the CI pipeline will build Docker images and push them to **Docker Hub**.
   - These Docker images will be deployed onto the host or a cloud platform using Docker Compose.

### **Git Management**

- **GitLab Repository** will be used for version control.
- Branching will follow this structure:
  - **master/main**: Stable production-ready branch.
  - **dev**: Active development branch.
  - **feature branches**: For new features or bug fixes.

### **Machine Learning Integration**

For the AI-powered task manager, we’ll integrate pre-trained **open-source machine learning models**. These can be integrated in two ways:
1. **Python-based Models (Flask/FastAPI)**:
   - Expose pre-trained models via HTTP API. For instance, the AI Service could use a HuggingFace transformer for NLP-based task categorization.
   
2. **JavaScript-based Models**:
   - Use **TensorFlow.js** or other JavaScript-based libraries if you wish to integrate machine learning directly in the frontend for a more immediate user experience.

### **Project Timeline**

- **Phase 1**: Setup of GitLab repository, Docker Compose configuration, and frontend with React (1-2 weeks).
- **Phase 2**: Implementation of Task Management Service and MongoDB integration (2 weeks).
- **Phase 3**: AI Service integration and API communication setup (2 weeks).
- **Phase 4**: CI/CD setup and deployment (1 week).
- **Phase 5**: Testing and optimization, presentation preparation (1 week).

### **Final Deliverables**
- **Source Code** hosted on GitLab.
- **README.md** detailing setup, dependencies, and running instructions.
- **AUTHORS.md** file with contributor names.
- **Presentation** (9-10 minutes).

### **Conclusion**
This architecture ensures a scalable, secure, and efficient solution for building an AI-powered task manager with microservices. By leveraging Docker, MongoDB, and React, the system is designed for easy scaling and deployment, while the integration of AI enhances its intelligence, providing a competitive edge for task management tools.
